Nonlinear Regression in MATLAB

A three parameter (a,b,c) model y = a + b/x + c ln(x) is fit to a set of data with the MATLAB APMonitor toolbox. This tutorial walks through the process of installing the solver, setting up the objective (normalized sum of squared errors), adjusting the parameter values to minimize the SSE, and plotting the results.

A frequent activity in data science and machine learning is to develop correlations from data. By importing the data into MATLAB, data analysis such as statistics, trending, or calculations can be made to synthesize the information into relevant and actionable information. This tutorial demonstrates how to create a function that best approximates the data trend and analyze the result. A script file of the MATLAB source code is available at http://apmonitor.com/che263/index.php...
